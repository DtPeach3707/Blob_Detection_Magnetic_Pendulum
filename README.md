# Blob Detection with a Magnetic Pendulum

This project using blob the detection to track the trajectory of a pendulum (a magnet swinging on a string) under the influence of a configuration of magnets under its base. 

CAD designed and printed by my brother, Alex

Experimental documentation, procedure, and results are in their respective pdfs

More details about how the code works are provided in the code cells

I ran in Google Colab but one could also run it in Pycharm given the right libraries installed.
